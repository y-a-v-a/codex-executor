description: Validate the codex, codex-review, and codex-discuss skills end-to-end in a session where the Codex CLI is available — preflight, hook unit tests, and per-skill smoke tests that prove context actually reaches Codex — then self-improve by recording each run and tightening checks when something breaks. Use when codex is installed and you want to confirm the skills still work.

You validate that the sibling Codex skills actually work against a *live* Codex
CLI, and you keep this validation flow sharp over time. The hard part of these
skills isn't running a command — it's proving the **context handoff** works:
`codex exec` is stateless, so every smoke test below is designed to confirm that
what you put in the prompt actually reached Codex, not just that a command exited 0.

## Scope

`$ARGUMENTS`

- No target, or `all` → run preflight, hooks, drift, and all three skill smoke tests.
- `codex` | `codex-review` | `codex-discuss` | `hooks` | `drift` → run just that suite.
- `--fix` → when a check fails, apply the fix to the offending skill (not only
  this validator) instead of only reporting it. Without `--fix`, propose the fix
  and ask before editing a sibling skill.

The skills under test live at `skills/codex/SKILL.md`,
`skills/codex-review/SKILL.md`, `skills/codex-discuss/SKILL.md`.

## 0. Preflight (always run first)

```bash
command -v codex && codex --version    # must exist — this skill is pointless without it
codex login status                     # must be authenticated
command -v jq                          # the validation hook needs jq
```

If `codex` is missing, **stop** and tell the user — there is nothing to validate.
Do the rest of the work in a throwaway directory so the repo stays clean. Make
it a git repo so `--cd "$SANDBOX"` is a real working tree:

```bash
SANDBOX="$(mktemp -d)"
( cd "$SANDBOX" && git init -q && git config user.email v@v && git config user.name v )
echo "$SANDBOX"
```

**Codex CLI gotchas (keep the flags below — don't "simplify" them away):**
- The sandbox isn't a trusted dir, so every `codex exec` needs
  `--skip-git-repo-check` and `--cd "$SANDBOX"`, or it exits with "Not inside a
  trusted directory" and writes nothing — a fake context-drop. `--cd` also keeps
  Codex from ingesting the whole invoking repo.
- `codex exec` can take several minutes — give shell calls a 10+ min timeout.

## 1. Hooks suite — the safety gate must hold

Run the allow/block unit tests against **every** script copy (all four:
codex, codex-review, codex-discuss, and this skill's own copy):

```bash
for s in skills/codex skills/codex-review skills/codex-discuss .claude/skills/codex-validate; do
  echo "== $s =="
  echo '{"tool_input":{"command":"codex exec test"}}' | bash "$s/scripts/validate-codex-command.sh"; echo "allow exit=$?"
  echo '{"tool_input":{"command":"codex exec --dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox test"}}' | bash "$s/scripts/validate-codex-command.sh"; echo "block exit=$?"
done
```

**Pass:** the danger flag blocks (exit 2) everywhere; a plain `codex exec`
is *not* blocked by the script's own rules (in a live session with codex on PATH
and authenticated, the allow case exits 0). **Fail:** any script lets the danger
flag through, or the four scripts diverge — they must stay identical.

## 1b. Drift suite — copied guidance must not go stale

Identical hook md5 (section 1) proves one unsafe command is blocked; it says
nothing about whether the *instructions users copy* have drifted (e.g. a flag a
newer Codex CLI deprecated). Scan the user-facing guidance surfaces:

```bash
bash .claude/skills/codex-validate/scripts/check-cli-drift.sh; echo "exit=$?"
```

**Pass:** exit 0 — no forbidden pattern in any guidance file. **Fail:** exit 1
with the offending `file:line` → a skill/doc still teaches a deprecated flag.
With `--fix`, replace it (e.g. `--full-auto` → `--sandbox workspace-write`) and
re-run to green; otherwise report the drift.

When a Codex release deprecates or renames a flag, add it to the `FORBIDDEN`
list in `scripts/check-cli-drift.sh` — that list is the live record of what
"current" means. The validator's own SKILL.md and `scripts/` are intentionally
not scanned: they name deprecated flags in order to test for them.

## 2. `codex` smoke test — does the brief reach Codex?

The point is to prove the gathered context drives the output, not just that a
file appeared. Plant a unique sentinel in the brief's constraints and assert it
shows up in the result:

```bash
SENT="csv_parse_$RANDOM"     # unique marker the model can only know from the brief
cat > "$SANDBOX/brief.md" <<EOF
## Intent
A working CSV parser exists in parser.py.
## Constraints / conventions
- The function MUST be named exactly: $SENT
## Task
Create parser.py with that one function; parse a comma-separated line into a list.
EOF
codex exec --sandbox workspace-write --skip-git-repo-check --cd "$SANDBOX" --output-last-message "$SANDBOX/out.txt" "$(cat "$SANDBOX/brief.md")"
grep -q "$SENT" "$SANDBOX/parser.py" && echo "PASS: brief reached Codex" || echo "FAIL: sentinel missing — context was dropped"
```

**Pass:** `parser.py` exists and contains the sentinel name. **Fail (the
regression we care about):** the file is missing the sentinel → the brief didn't
reach Codex, i.e. the skill is back to throwing context away. Fix `skills/codex`.

## 3. `codex-review` smoke test — does the diff reach the reviewer?

Feed a diff with one obvious, specific defect and assert the review names it:

```bash
printf 'def charge(amount):\n    API_KEY = "sk-live-1234567890"\n    return bill(API_KEY, amount)\n' > "$SANDBOX/pay.py"
( cd "$SANDBOX" && git init -q && git add pay.py && git commit -qm seed && \
  sed -i 's/return bill/return  bill/' pay.py && git diff > review.diff )
cat > "$SANDBOX/rbrief.md" <<EOF
## Intent
Billing helper; must not leak secrets.
## Instructions
For each finding give severity, category, file:line, problem, and a fix.
## Diff
\`\`\`diff
$(cat "$SANDBOX/review.diff")
\`\`\`
EOF
codex exec --sandbox read-only --skip-git-repo-check --cd "$SANDBOX" --output-last-message "$SANDBOX/rout.md" "$(cat "$SANDBOX/rbrief.md")"
grep -qiE 'api_key|secret|hardcoded' "$SANDBOX/rout.md" && echo "PASS: diff reached reviewer" || echo "FAIL: hardcoded secret not flagged — diff was dropped"
```

**Pass:** the review flags the hardcoded key (proving the diff content reached
Codex). **Fail:** generic output with no reference to the planted defect → the
diff was dropped (e.g. passed as a stray second positional arg). Fix `skills/codex-review`.

## 4. `codex-discuss` smoke test — structure and grounding

Run a short, capped discussion on a trivial topic and check the *shape* of the
artifact rather than the conclusion:

```bash
codex exec --sandbox read-only --skip-git-repo-check --cd "$SANDBOX" --output-last-message "$SANDBOX/turn.md" \
  "You are the challenger in a design discussion. Read nothing; the proposal is: \
   'store config in a single JSON file'. Raise one substantive objection and end \
   with a line: 'Signal: AGREE | AGREE_WITH_CAVEATS | DISAGREE | NEEDS_INFO'."
grep -qE '^Signal:' "$SANDBOX/turn.md" && echo "PASS: challenger emits a Signal" || echo "FAIL: no Signal line — convergence detection will break"
```

Also confirm by reading `skills/codex-discuss/SKILL.md` that the round-1 prompt
still grounds the challenger in repo context and the loop still defines
CONVERGED / IMPASSE. **Fail:** no `Signal:` line, or the convergence rules went
missing.

## 5. Cleanup & report

```bash
rm -rf "$SANDBOX"
```

Report a table: each suite → PASS / FAIL / SKIPPED, with the one-line reason for
any failure. Lead with failures. End with the path to this skill's validation
log (below) so the user can see the trail.

## Self-improvement (do this every run — it is part of the job)

This skill is the single source of truth for *how we validate*, and it is
expected to get better each time you run it. After reporting:

1. **On any failure, find the root cause and fix the right file.**
   - Skill regression (context dropped, Signal gone, hook weakened) → fix the
     offending sibling skill. With `--fix`, edit it now; otherwise propose the
     diff and ask first. Re-run that suite to confirm green.
   - A flaky check (e.g. an over-strict `grep`) → fix the check *here* so it
     stops crying wolf.

2. **When the Codex CLI surface changes** (a flag renamed, `codex review`
   behavior shifts, a new sandbox mode) and a check breaks because of it: update
   the smoke test here AND the affected skill/`docs/reference.md` to match, so
   the skills track reality.

3. **When you discover a sharper check** — a failure mode these tests would have
   missed — add it as a new step rather than leaving it in your head. The next
   run should catch what this run only caught by luck.

4. **Always append one entry to the log below**, even on a clean pass. Keep it to
   the newest ~10 entries; summarize and drop older ones. This is what makes the
   skill self-improving instead of self-forgetting: each run leaves the next run
   a better map of where these skills tend to break.

Never edit a sibling skill silently — every change you make to one must show up
as a log entry here describing what broke and what you changed.

## Validation log

<!-- Newest first. Template:
### <date> — target: <all|codex|...>  result: <PASS|FAIL>

- Fix applied: <file(s) changed, or "none">
- Check added/changed: <new or tightened check here, or "none">
-->

### 2026-06-26 — target: drift  result: PASS (closes codex-discuss objection O5)
- Suites: drift PASS.
- What & why: a `codex-discuss` run on the skill suite agreed (O5) that md5-identical
  hooks prove safety but not that copied *guidance* stays current. Added
  `scripts/check-cli-drift.sh` + the §1b drift suite to catch that.
- Acceptance test met: check FAILED on the stale `--full-auto` in
  skills/codex/SKILL.md (×3) and docs/reference.md (×1), then PASSED after
  replacing them with `--sandbox workspace-write`.
- Fix applied: skills/codex/SKILL.md, docs/reference.md (user-approved fix-forward);
  new drift script + §1b in this skill. The validator's own SKILL.md/scripts are
  excluded from the scan (they name deprecated flags to test for them).
- Check added: §1b drift suite. Extend its `FORBIDDEN` list on each CLI deprecation.

### 2026-06-25 — target: all  result: PASS (after fixing this validator)
- Suites: hooks PASS, codex PASS, codex-review PASS, codex-discuss PASS.
- Failure & root cause: codex smoke test (§2) failed first — **not** a skill
  regression. codex 0.141.0 deprecated `--full-auto` and now refuses to run
  outside a trusted dir, so with `--cd "$SANDBOX"` (a fresh mktemp) and no
  `--skip-git-repo-check` Codex exited with "Not inside a trusted directory" and
  wrote no file → looked like a context-drop. Re-running with a git-init'd
  sandbox + `--sandbox workspace-write --skip-git-repo-check` confirmed the
  sentinel reached Codex. Also caught the review smoke test (§3) hanging ~7 min
  because it ran without `--cd`, ingesting the whole invoking repo.
- Fix applied: this skill only — §0 git-inits the sandbox + documents the CLI
  surface; §2 uses `--sandbox workspace-write --skip-git-repo-check`; §3/§4 add
  `--cd "$SANDBOX" --skip-git-repo-check`. No sibling skill edited (`--fix` not
  passed).
- Check added/changed: added generic Codex CLI gotchas (trusted-dir +
  `--cd`, long timeouts) so these env failures aren't misread as context drops.
  Scoped §3/§4 to the sandbox.
- Open item: RESOLVED 2026-06-26 (see entry above) — `--full-auto` replaced with
  `--sandbox workspace-write` in skills/codex/SKILL.md + docs/reference.md, now
  guarded by the §1b drift suite.
